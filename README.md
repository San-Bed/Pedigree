# Population-Dynamics-Study

This small command-line program studies genetic inheritance in a human population by simulation. In particular, 
we developed a platform for simulating random events (birth, reproduction and death) in the lives of a Sim population 
and examined the coalescence of ancestral lines. This was an assignment for my IFT 2015 - Data Structures class.

# Installation

From `src` folder, run the following command, where `n` is the number of founders and `Tmax` is the duration.

```
java pedigree/Runner n Tmax
```
After the simulation is completed, it will print on screen 3 data sets:

1. { Time, Population size }
2. { Time, Number of ancestral paternal lines }
3. { Time, Number of ancestral maternal lines }

# What I learned

* Priority queues and how to manually implement them using arrays
* Parametrics types and Comparables
* System.in and System.out for inputs and outputs
* [Gompertz-Makeham model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertzâ€“Makeham_law_of_mortality) for the mortality rate in a population
